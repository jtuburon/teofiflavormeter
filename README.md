# TeofiFlavorMeter

TeofiFlavorMeter is an application developed to show my friends how much flavor someone or something has, and how much flavor I currrently have. 

### Development
It was developed using the following tools:
  - Tizen IDE 2.4
  - Tizen SDK.
  - Tizen Web Simulator 2.4

### Deployment
It was deployed on my Galaxy Gear 2's smartwatch.

Here we have some pics:
